# Product Recommender
This application helps you discover new products you might like based on 
previously rated products. For example if you have enjoyed several movies 
starring Tom Cruise, you might also enjoy any other movies starring Tom Cruise.

How this works is that the application takes multiple attributes of a product 
type and calculates their respective correlations and covariances with a score 
of that product. When more than one product are rated, the attributes 
themselves get relative correlation that tell how significant they are to 
calculate rating.

The reason for these calculations is that you may not consciously know why 
you're enjoying both the movie *Valkyrie (Bryan Singer, 2008)* and *Magnolia 
(Paul Thomas Anderson, 1999)*. Perhaps it's because they're both starring Tom 
Cruise, or perhaps it's because they're both produced in the US, or something 
else entirely. By using this application, the correlations are calculated 
automatically and by rating more and more products, a taste profile is built 
up specifically tailored for you. You may discover that you enjoy Venezuelan 
comedies from the 1970's that are shorter than 90 minutes. This application 
will then recommend you more of that kind of movies.
